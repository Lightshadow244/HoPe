"Help us to make this world (where we are living in) as fair as possible. We "

"drawers thinking as well as cliché thinking and exclusion. We support "
"because we are convinced in a community its easier and more efficient to "

"We are of the opinion that the people in Ghana themselves know best what is "
"needed and what is not. For this reason we only send money to Ghana and do "
"not send donations in kind which would have to be sent from Germany to "
"Ghana. This way we not only save alot of transport costs which could be "
"better used elsewhere, but we also make sure that things arrive which are "
"needed and not left unused. Your donation will always be used where it is "
"needed most. This depends on upcoming projects. But that is too vaguefor "
"you? We have the right solution for you here as well. You can easily and "
"actively determine for yourself what your money is to be used for. Whether "
"in teaching materials, such as pens, notebooks or chairs, or rather in "
"current or already existing projects,such as tree seedlings, cotton bags or "
"even in the financing of our upcoming expansion to Motte? This choice is "
"left to you, within a certain predefined range. The reason why you do not "
"have complete freedom of choice is that we do not want to finance in "
"thingsthat are not needed. This way the money is used optimally and exactly "
"where it is needed. Because the local people simply know best what is needed "
"and what is not."
